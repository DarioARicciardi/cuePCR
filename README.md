# cuePCR
Quick and easy quantitative RT-PCR analysis!

cuePCR is an R-based tool for the analysis of quantitative real-time RT-PCR data.
It uses the comparative deltadeltaCT method with efficiency correction and subsequent
statistical analysis. The results are presented in a bar plot that can be deeply customized
and downloaded as a vector image. All generated data can be downloaded after the analysis.

Visit https://darioar.shinyapps.io/cuepcr/ to run the web-based version of cuePCR.

If you prefer to run a local instance, download the whole repository and open the app.R script in R-Studio.
Execute the last line to run the app or click the "Run App" button in the top right corner.
